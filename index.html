    <h3>A funny story</h3>
    <p>When I was little, my parents, very conventional people, told me people riding red cars were crazy, because they considered it was unthinkable to buy a red car. But I understood drivers of red cars were really crazy, so I watched them with fear. I now have a red car...</p>
    <h4>TL;DR</h4>
    <p>When I was little, I tought people in red cars where crazy.</p>
